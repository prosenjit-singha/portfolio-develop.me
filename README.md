<!-- include link to /users -->

[Users/Location](https://portfolio-develop-me.vercel.app/location-sharing)

<!-- note warning -->

> Note: SignalR Hub will not work because of the CORS policy. But it will work from the local development environment.

> User List: Since https://tech-test.raintor.com/user/GetUsersList?take=10&skip=0 doesn't work, I am using faker.js to generate fake users which give us the same data as the API would return.
